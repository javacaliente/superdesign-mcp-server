Here are the commands to update your fork with the latest changes from the original repository.

**1. Add a Remote to the Original Repository (Only needs to be done once)**

This command adds a remote that points to the original repository. By convention, this is usually named `upstream`.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jonthebeef/superdesign-mcp-claude-code
```

**2. Fetch the Changes**

This command downloads the latest changes from the original repository without merging them into your local branches.

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

**3. Switch to Your Main Branch**

This command ensures you are on your main branch before merging.

```bash
git checkout main
```

**4. Merge the Changes**

This command merges the changes from the `upstream`'s main branch into your local main branch.

```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

**5. Push the Changes to Your Fork**

This command pushes the updated main branch to your fork on GitHub (the `origin` remote).

```bash
git push origin main
